# Overview of the available labs

## Lab1: Data Warehouse Optimization 

[Data Warehouse Optimization Lab](../Labs/Lab1_Data_Warehouse_Optimization/Lab_1_Data_Offload_Guide.md) demonstrates how to reduce the operational cost of running the Data Warehouse environment. In-addition to reducing the operations cost of the Data Warehouse the data will be unified in the Open Hybrid Lakehouse, watsonx.data platform for Analytical and AI applications.

## Lab2: Spark

[Data Lakehouse Lab](../Labs/Lab2_Data_Lakehouse/Lab2_Data_Lakehouse_Guide.md) demonstrates:
- Workflow with hive and iceberg catalogs to handle different workflows.
- Support for data federation so that data can be consumed from the source rather than making additional copies. 
- Using the fit for purpose engine (Spark) to Transform, aggregate and cleanse the data in-order to expose high quality data for Analytical and AI applications.

## Lab3: Data Protection Rules
*Currently limited to demo*

Follow instructions in the [Data Governance Guide](../Labs/Lab3_Data_Governance/Lab%203%20wdi%20Data%20Protection%20Guide%20v2.md) aims at showing watsonx.data capabilities to integrate with Knowledge Catalog to explore your data, establish efficient access to data and protect sensitive data.

## Lab4: RAG Agent

This lab implements an Agentic RAG pipeline using watsonx.data Milvus vector database, and watsonx Orchestrate as the user interface for interacting with the agent. 

Follow the steps in the [Agentic RAG Guide](../Labs/Lab4_Agentic_RAG/Agentic_RAG_Guide.md) to create the RAG agent.

## Lab5: Natural Language to SQL Agent

This lab creates an agent that can convert user Natural Language queries into SQL queries and leveraging the presto engine in watsonx.data, query the data and respond back to the user with the answer.  

Follow instructions in the [Natural Language to SQL Guide](../Labs/Lab5_NL2SQL/NL2SQL_Guide.md)to create the NL2SQL Agent.
