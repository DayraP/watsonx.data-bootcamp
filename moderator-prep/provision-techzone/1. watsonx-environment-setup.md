# 1. Getting Started

## 1.1 Clone the classroom Repo

Clone the classroom Repo via SSH
```sh
git clone [moderator add SSH to classroom repo]
```

If you are not setup for SSH, you can download via Browser instead:

* Go to: [moderator add http link to classroom repo]

* Click on Code, Download Zip

style="width:6.5in;height:2.94861in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

## 1.2 Provision the techzone environment

For completing this bootcamp you will need the following services.
* watsonx.data
* Cloud Object Storage (COS)
* IBM watsonx.data intelligence
* watsonx.ai Studio & Runtime
* watsonx Orchestrate

Provision the watsonx.data TechZone [bundle](https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/67e6c2a9bc768d343f1c08ea), which has all the components needed for the hands-on labs

## 1.3 Open your Techzone Reservation

* Go to your techzone reservation list:
<https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations>

* Look for your recently created reservation and click "Open this
environment".

* Scroll down and look for the name of the Cloud Account (should be
watsonx-events or watsonx-events2)

<img src="./attachments/image6.png"
style="width:5.33333in;height:2.875in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

## 1.4 Login to your Techzone environment 

* Go to: <https://cloud.ibm.com/resources>

* Login with your IBM credentials

## 1.5 Verify you are in the right instance. 

Check at the top right that you are in the right instance –
**watsonx-events** or **watsonx-events2**

<img src="./attachments/image7.png"
style="width:6.30556in;height:0.98611in"
alt="A black and white stripe AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

If it does not show the right name of the instance, you can select it from the drop-down.

<font color="red">**CAUTION:**</font>  The instance at the top right tends to change to your default personal account every time you switch/go back to a new page. Thus, it's always good to check the top right corner **every time** you switch to a new page.

## 1.6 Open a Text Editor of your choice

Open a text-based notepad to use as a ready reference for the lab.  The labs will have call outs to copy information that will be needed for future configuration steps.

Examples: Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac or use `.txt` file in VSCode.  

## 1.7 Create a Cloud API key

From the IBM Cloud interface use to the top menu
![Manage Access](attachments/2025-04-23-11-24-04-pasted-vscode.png)
* Manage -> Access IAM 
* From the Left Navigation click Manage Identities -> API Keys
* Click on the Create button
* Name you key **CLOUD_API_KEY** and click Create with the defaults
* Save **CLOUD_API_KEY** to your text Reference
* Download the file to your laptop / desktop.

# 2. Setup the Cloud Object Storage Buckets for watsonx.data

The purpose of creating the COS buckets is to the source data sets used in the lab in their respective COS buckets.

* From the IBM Cloud page, Click on Hamburger menu, Go to Resource List, and select Storage
![Storage instance](attachments/2025-04-23-11-26-03-pasted-vscode.png)
* Open Cloud Object Storage Instance (in a new tab)  
:warning:  *Make sure that all buckets have the same location*

The following 4 buckets are needed for the lab:

1. **Wxd bucket**: For watsonx.data (iceberg catalog)
2. **Hive bucket**: For Hive catalog
3. **Milvus bucket**: For Milvus service
4. **Input-data bucket**: For Input data

## 2.1 Create Wxd bucket

* Click on the 'Create Bucket +' button.
* Click 'create' at the bottom of the "Create a Custom Bucket" tile.
* Add “**wxd-**“ prefix to the autogenerated bucket name.
* Take default for rest of the settings.
* Change location to correspond to location of your watsonx.data
* Select Create bucket
* Save Wxd `bucket name` to your text Reference (you will use in a future step)
![](attachments/2025-04-23-11-31-01-pasted-vscode.png)

## 2.2 Create Hive bucket

* Go back to your COS Instance and Create another bucket for Hive (you will use this for ingesting data)

* Click on the 'Create Bucket +' button.
* Click 'create' at the bottom of the  "Create a Custom Bucket" tile.
* Add “**hive-**“ prefix to the autogenerated bucket name.
* Change location to correspond to location of your watsonx.data
* Take default for rest of the settings.
* Select Create bucket
* Save Hive `bucket name` to your text Reference (you will use in a future step)

## 2.3 Create Milvus bucket

* Go back to your COS Instance and Create another bucket for Milvus (you will use this for storing the vector data)

* Select + to Create Bucket, Select Create a custom bucket, Create
* Add “**milvus-**“ prefix tothe autogenerated bucket name.
* Change location to correspond to location of your watsonx.data
* Take default for rest of the settings.
* Select Create bucket
* Save Milvus `bucket name` to your text Reference (you will use in a future step)

## 2.4 Create Input-data bucket

* Go back to your COS Instance and Create another bucket for Input-data

* Select + to Create Bucket, Select Create a custom bucket, Create
* Add “**input-data-“** prefix to the autogenerated bucket name.
* Change location to correspond to location of your watsonx.data
* Take default for rest of the settings.
* Select Create bucket
* Save Input-data bucket `bucket name` to your text Reference (you will use in a future step)

Once you perform steps 2.2.1 to 2.2.4 you should have screen similar to the one below.
![COS buckets](attachments/2025-04-23-11-36-58-pasted-vscode.png)

## 2.5 Create COS Service Credentials

From you storage interface, go to your COS Instance, and go to the `Service Credentials` tab.

<img src="./attachments/Screenshot_New_Credentials.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:2.46319in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

* Select `+ New Credential`

* Name: `cos_credentials`

* Role: `Manager`

* Enable option for `HMAC Credentials`

<img src="./attachments/image11.png"
style="width:5.86111in;height:3.65278in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

* Select the twistie to show your credentials

* Copy and paste the credentials json to your text Reference (you will use
in a future step)

style="width:5.01389in;height:3.95833in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />


## 2.6 Find your Endpoint

* Go to `Buckets` Tab in your COS instance, Select Bucketname, Click on `Configuration`, jump to `Endpoints`
* Since all your buckets are created under the same `Location` they will have the same `Endpoints`

<img src="./attachments/image13.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:3.76944in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

* Copy the **Public** endpoint where your techzone instance was
provisioned pre-pended with https:// into your text Reference  (you will use in a future step).

* For example – Dallas is
`s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud`  
Save in your reference as: `https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud`
